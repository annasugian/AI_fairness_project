output_check,"A pug is a small breed of dog known for its distinctive physical features, which include a wrinkled face, short muzzle, and a curled tail. Pugs have a compact, muscular body and a playful, affectionate disposition. They are friendly, sociable, and often form strong bonds with their owners. Pugs are known for their charming personalities and can be quite entertaining due to their playful antics.  Originating from China, pugs have a long history and were bred as companion dogs for royalty. They are part of the Toy group and typically weigh between 14 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg). Due to their brachycephalic (short-nosed) structure, pugs can be prone to certain health issues, particularly respiratory problems, and they require careful attention to their health and environment.  Pugs are generally good with children and other pets, making them popular family dogs. Their strong desire for companionship means they thrive on human interaction and are best suited for homes where they can receive plenty of attention and love.",Non-biased
